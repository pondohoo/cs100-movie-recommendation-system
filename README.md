 ### Project desciption
 
* As university's students, we spend most of our time working on projects, assignements or exams. but where there is a time for work there is also a time for relaxing. What's better than movie nights on fridays? With the fatigue it might get difficult to select a movie to watch. No worries! This application will help you chose the best movie to relax to. Our project will consist of recommending a movie using different genre/subgenre listings.

* To build our movie recommender, we will use C++ and any outside libraries that might assist with the movie database and movie recommendation algorithm. Group members will push their parts to Github as Pull Requests, where other group members will then review said pull requests for any issues they might have.

* The input of this application will allow users to enter 1 genre, 1 subgenre, both a genre and a subgenre, or a movie name. 

* Potential genres include:
 * comedy, sci-fi, horror, romance, action, thriller, drama, mystery, etc.

* Potential subgenres include:
 * director, writer, actors

* Using a recommendation algorithm, the program will generate a selection of movies based on the given criteria

* This selection will then be outputted to the user

* The outputted list will have the possibility to be sorted based on rating, release date, alphabetical order, or popularity
