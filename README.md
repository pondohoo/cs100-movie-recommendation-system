 **Project desciption**
 
As university's students, we spend most of our time working on projects, assignements or exams. but where there is a time for work there is also a time for relaxing. What's better than movie nights on fridays? With the fatigue it might get difficult to select a movie to watch. No worries! This application will help you chose the best movie to relax to. Our project will consist of recommending a movie using different genre/subgenre listings.
To build our movie recommender, we will use the language C++ on Visual Studio Code. Each member will contribute equally to the project and we will be able to regroup and verify each other code using a GitHub repository. 
The input of this application will allow user to enter a genre and a subgenre and the possibility to enter a movie that they like. In the output, the application will recommend a selection of movies with the chosen genre and subgenre. The recommended movies will be based on the caracteristics (genre/subgenre) of the movie that they like.
